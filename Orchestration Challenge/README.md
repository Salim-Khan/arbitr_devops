# Orchestration Challenge

## Introduction
For this challenge, we have provided you with some python code. We need your help to automatically deploy this code to a host automatically! Utilize Ansible (preferred), Puppet, or any other orchestration framework to accomplish this task! 

### Criteria
- Setup an Ubuntu host to deploy the Code to. (Other platforms are allowed, but a free platform is preferred)
- Create a New User
- Install Python
- Limit ports to only allow Python code API ports and SSH
- Copy Python code to host
- Run Python Script within the context of the newly created user

#### Bonus
- Create Python harness to interact with Python Code APIs
- Document how to utilize script to test API functionality

### Expected Results
- Orchestration code that will perform all of the Criteria
- Documentation on orchestration code functionality

#### Troubleshooting/Help
- If you encounter any issues with this lab, reach out to employment@arbitrsecurity.com or your HR representative and mention an issue with the "DevOps Orchestration Challenge"
