# Container Challenge

## Introduction
For this challenge, we have provided you with some python code, the only issue is we don't want to have the overhead of this code needing an entire host. So we need it containerized, showcase your Docker and scripting skills! 

### Criteria
- Create a container that will hold the Python Code
- Configure container to allow all python script functionality
- Create script to interact with all TestAPI's exposed from Docker container
- Create walkthrough documenting all of the steps taken to complete lab

#### Bonus
- Document how to utilize script to test API functionality
- Show optimizations in Containerization

### Expected Results
- Python Code is fully functional within a Container
- Applicant has created Script to interact with all API funcionality
- Documentation on what all steps were taken

#### Troubleshooting/Help
- If you encounter any issues with this lab, reach out to employment@arbitrsecurity.com or your HR representative and mention an issue with the "DevOps Container Challenge"
